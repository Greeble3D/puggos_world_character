# Puggo's World Character

The main character avatar for Puggo's World.

Use the PW custom editor to edit this addon: https://github.com/LeoBlanchette/puggos_world_sdk/releases/tag/PW4.3.1 

Avatar is made to be autonomous so that users may mod it easily.

Run res://addons/avatar_testing.tscn in play mode to preview character.

Note that this avatar is used simultaneously in the game [as well as the SDK](https://github.com/LeoBlanchette/puggos_world_sdk), so that users may preview changes.

More documentation will be written as things mature.

- move_forward (w)
